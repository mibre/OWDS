# What Is OWDS?
  OWDS stands for One-Wire Data Suite and is a data logging / presenting
  software for 1wire networks.
  It is written in Perl and should run on any platform that Perl
  runs on.
  At the time of writing the project is still in Alpha and the initial
  focus is on the logging side of things.  

# How Do I Install/Configure It?
  * Unpack the files in a directory of your choice.
  * Run setup.pl which will help you;
    - configure the program to use owserver or OWFS directly
    - Depending on the choice above, configure either the owserver 
      settings or the path to your owfs mount point.
    - Add your 1wire devices to the database. 
  * You're done! Now see "How Do I Use It?"

# How Do I Use It?
  To start using OWDS there are two basic steps you need to perform;
  * Run setup.pl
  * Make Collector.pl run on an interval of your choice, if you're on Linux, 
    adding it to crontab would be a good idea!
  There are four different parts to the suite;
  Collector - the program that collects the data and adds measurements to the DB
  Presenter - A command line program that lets you look at the data in the DB
  Setup - A program that lets you configure the system according 
                 to your 1wire network, adding devices to log from etc.
  Web [TBD] - A web config and data viewing tool.
